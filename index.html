			<h1>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>The “philosophy” of the internet</h2>
			<p>I think the idea of the internet is all about <b>sharing</b>. To achieve this, we connect the computers into a network. To communicate efficiently across the machines and people, we develop some rules for both data representation and transmission, such as the HTML format and the HTTP protocol.</p>
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>HTML</h2>
			<p>HTML is a way to maintain a balance between <em>development</em> and <em>representation</em>: easy to develop, easy to incorporate all kind of contents and comfortable to read.</p>	
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
			<p>Unlike the <b>inline element</b>, the <b>block element</b> is a kind of hierarchical representation. To wrap or not to wrap, that is the question.</p>

			<h2>Useful tools</h2>

			<h1>Lesson 2 Creating a Structured Document</h1>
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>Why begin with web development?</h2>
			<p>First, it would be fun to know how to develop a webpage. <br>Second, the webpages we build can be easily visualized in realtime, which makes it more convenient to receive feedbacks or share the results with others.</p>
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>The roles of HTML and CSS</h2>
			<p>HTML: the structure (or layout) of the webpage;<br>CSS: the style (or decoration) of the webpage;<br>Javascript: the interactive component of the webpage.</p>
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>Tree-like structure and boxification</h2>
			<p>The joint effect of tree-like structure and boxification makes it more easy to divide a complicated webpage into several simple components. Also, such divisions facilitate the styling of the webpage in CSS.</p>
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin">
			<h1>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h1>
		</div> <!-- class="row-thin" -->

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>CSS</h2>
			<p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." The main function of them is to control the style of HTML elements. Usually the minimum "unit" in HTML that CSS style apply to is a "class" structure. To add style to HTML structure, we may have to specify the directory of the CSS file within the "head" section of the HTML file.</p>

		<div class="row-thin gray">
			<h2>Avoiding Repetition</h2>
			<p>Human are not good at repetition because it is both tedious and error-prone. That's why we invented computers, which are good at repetition. Therefore, to make the best use of computers, we should avoid manual repetition and let computers do their excellent jobs. </p>
