<b>The “philosophy” of the internet</b>
<p>I think the idea of the internet is all about <b>sharing</b>. To achieve this, we connect the computers into a network. To communicate efficiently across the machines and people, we develop some rules for both data representation and transmission, such as the HTML format and the HTTP protocol.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is a way to maintain a balance between <em>development</em> and <em>representation</em>: easy to develop, easy to incorporate all kind of contents and comfortable to read.
</p>

<b>Hierarchy</b>
<p>Unlike the <b>inline element</b>, the <b>block element</b> is a kind of hierarchical representation. To wrap or not to wrap, that is the question.
